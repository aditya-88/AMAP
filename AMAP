## AMAP F/R/FR Forward_seq.ab1 Reverse_seq.ab1 Reference_seq.fasta                                                              ##
## Where:                                                                                                                       ##
## 'F' means you are giving only forward sequences for alignment                                                                ##
## 'R' means you are giving only reverse sequences for alignment                                                                ##
## 'FR' means you are giving both Forward and Reverse sequences for alignment                                                   ##
## For multiplex usage for n number of samples:                                                                                 ##
## Example:                                                                                                                     ##
## n = 2; That is, Sample A and B.                                                                                              ##
## Typical Usage for such a sceneario:                                                                                          ##
## AMAP Forward_seq_Sample_A.ab1 Forward_seq_Sample_B.ab1 Reverse_seq_Sample_A.ab1 Reverse_seq_Sample_B.ab1 Reference_Seq.fasta ##
## Reverse Sequence should not be reverse complemented, the software does it on it's own.                                       ##
## Kindly note that SeaView will not be automatically launched in case of multiplex run.                                        ##
## You can manually open the *._result.aln file to visualize the alignment.                                                     ##
## Requirements:                                                                                                                ##
